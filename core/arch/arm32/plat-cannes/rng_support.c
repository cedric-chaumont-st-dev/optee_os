	 * - HOST FIFO size = 8x8b (64b)
	 * - LSB (16b) of the RNG_VAL register allows to read 16b
	 * - bit5 of the RNG_STATUS register allows to known if the HOST
	 *   FIFO is full or not.
	 * - bit1,0 of the RNG_STATUS register allows to known if the
	 *   data are valid.
	 *
	 * Main principle:
	 *  For performance reason, a local SW fifo is used to store the
	 *  content of the HOST FIFO (max size = 8bytes). When a random
	 *  value is expected, this SW fifo is used to return a stored value.
	 *  When the local SW fifo is empty, it is filled with the HOST FIFO
	 *  according the following sequence:
	 *
	 *  - wait HOST FIFO full
	 *      o Indicates that max 8-bytes (64b) are available
	 *      o This is mandatory to guarantee that a valid data is
	 *      available. No STATUS bit to indicate that the HOST FIFO
	 *      is empty is provided.
	 *  - check STATUS bits
	 *  - update the local SW fifo with the HOST FIFO
	 *
	 *  This avoid to wait at each iteration that a valid random value is
	 *  available. _LOCAL_FIFO_SIZE indicates the size of the local SW fifo.
